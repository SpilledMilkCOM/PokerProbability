# PokerProbability
### A website that calculates your chances of winning poker after the flop.

+ Using Angular 2 and TypeScript with Visual Studio
+ Using Reactive Extensions for JavaScript (RxJs) for the Http calls.
+ A learning tool so I can learn how to build a site using Angular 2
+ Keep interface simple and plain so opponents think you're just texting.

+ Hopefully has good examples of overloading Equals and operator==
+ More examples of CompareTo()

#### Upgrade package versions
This initial version started in Angular 2.0 and I'd like to update this to the **latest** version of Angular
and all of its components.

+ `npm outdated` - Shows the packages that are out of date
+ `npm install -g npm-check-updates` - Installs `ncu` so you can check what the latest versions are available
+ `ncu` - Shows the current package version of all the packages as well as their **latest** available version
